ansible-role-mysql
==================

An Ansible role, available via [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com), that installs and configures mysql.

This role works with [our repo to create a vagrant virtualbox vm](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-roles-vagrant), but is easily modifed to work with actual ubuntu boxes.

You'll probably want to amend / override:

* `defaults/main.yml`

* the `hosts`, as specified in the example playbook at `main.yml`:

        - hosts: whatever

Installation
------------

Preusming a `requirements.yml` as follows:

    # Install a role from GitHub
    - name: ansible-role-mysql
    src: https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-mysql

we can install the role locally:

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p ./roles


Requirements
------------

You may already have:

* Created a vagrant VirtualBox virtual machine using [ansible-roles-vagrant](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-users)
* Provisioned the virtual machine with users using [ansible-role-users](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-users)
* Installled various common packages using [ansible_role_common](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-common)

Role Variables
--------------

Available variables are listed below, along with default values as found in `defaults/main.yml`:

    ansible_role_mysql:
      user: root
      password: changeme
      db: whatever
      db_host: localhost
      db_user: whatever
      db_password: changeme
      encoding: utf8
      collation: utf8_unicode_ci

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

Our `hosts` file, as generated by [our repo to create a vagrant virtualbox vm](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-roles-vagrant):

    [vagrant]
    host1 ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_port=2222 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=../.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key

We include a playbook at `main.yml`.

Running the playbook:

    # Note that we're presuming our hosts file has been generated by our vagrant repo
    ansible all -m ping -i ../vagrant/ansible/hosts -l whatever

    ansible-playbook -l whatever main.yml -i ../vagrant/ansible/hosts

    # Check that our packages have been installed
    ansible -m shell -a 'zip -h' whatever -i ../vagrant/ansible/hosts
